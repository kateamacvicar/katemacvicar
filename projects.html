        <h4> Web Application for Music Sharing</h4>
        <p> 
            In the Spring of 2022, I worked in a team that used 
            Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL to create a 
            Web Application that allows users to create a 
            profile to share music with friends.

        <h4> Mobile App for spreading information across Wellesley's Campus</h4>
        <p> 
            During the Fall of 2021, I worked in a small team with two other 
            Wellesley students to develop an app that serves as a 
            platform for spreading information across our college 
            campus using React Native. This app used Firebase features 
            like Cloud Firestore and authentication to store and save 
            user data in a database.

        <h3> Malibu Good Foods Burdock Tea Label </h3>
        <p> 
            During the summer of 2020, I worked closely with a Wellesley 
            alumna to design and create a tea label for her start up company. 
            In addition, I was able to take on more projects, like designing 
            and creating her company logo and helping to design and improve 
            her website. During that internship, I was given the chance to 
            become more comfortable with popular graphic software like Adobe 
            Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
